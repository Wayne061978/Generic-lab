Understanding Generics in Java

This project demonstrates the use of **Java Generics** to create reusable, type-safe, and flexible code. The program showcases generics through a combination of abstract and concrete implementations, using classes, interfaces, and methods.


ðŸ“š Lab Objectives

1. Generic Class: Demonstrates bounded generics using T extends Employee.
2. Generic Interface: Implements an interface to print generic values.
3. Generic Method: Processes and prints lists of any type using a generic method.
4. Inheritance with Generics: Highlights polymorphism between Employee and SalariedEmployee.


ðŸ›  Features

- Generic Class:
  - Handles objects of type Employee and its subclasses.
  - Displays employee details.

- Generic Interface:
  - Prints values of any type dynamically.

- Generic Method:
  - Prints a list of any type, allowing flexibility and reusability.

- Inheritance:
  - Demonstrates how generics work with subclasses.


ðŸ“‹ Completion Status

âœ… All lab objectives implemented.  
âœ… Tested functionality with Employee and SalariedEmployee.  
âœ… Ready for deployment and extension.
